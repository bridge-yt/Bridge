# Bridge Application: Detailed Explanation

**Objective**:
The goal of the Bridge application is to create a configuration management platform that allows different tools (like Terraform, Crossplane, and ArgoCD) to reference and share resources seamlessly. When a resource is created in Terraform, its ARN can be referenced automatically by other tools without manual updates.

**Core Concept**:
The Bridge application acts as a central registry for resources, where each resource can be registered, updated, and queried by its name. The application exposes an API to manage these resources.

## Key Features:

1. **Resource Registration**:
   - When a resource is created in Terraform with the Bridge provider, it is automatically registered in the Bridge application with a unique name and its ARN.

2. **Automatic Reference**:
   - Other tools can reference resources by their name using a special syntax (e.g., `bridge:://resource-name`), and the Bridge application resolves this to the actual ARN.

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - The Bridge application provides endpoints to register, update, and delete resources, ensuring that all tools have consistent and up-to-date configuration data.

4. **Different Providers**:
   - **Terraform Provider**: Allows Terraform to automatically register and query resources from Bridge.
   - **Crossplane Provider**: Enables Crossplane to interact with the Bridge for resource management.
   - **ArgoCD Integration**: Provides seamless integration with ArgoCD for continuous delivery.

```


## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bridge.git
cd bridge
```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r api/requirements.txt
```

4. **Set Up the Database**:

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
flask db upgrade
```

## Running the Application

1. **Run the Flask Application**:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=bridge.api.app
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

## Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

```bash
docker build -t bridge-app .
```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name bridge-app bridge-app
```

## API Endpoints

- **Register a Resource**: `POST /api/resource/<namespace>`
- **Get a Resource**: `GET /api/resource/<namespace>/<name>`
- **Get All Resources from a Namespace**: `GET /api/resource/<namespace>/all`
- **Get All Resources**: `GET /api/resources`
- **Update a Resource**: `PUT /api/resource/<namespace>/<name>`
- **Delete a Resource**: `DELETE /api/resource/<namespace>/<name>`
- **Search Resources**: `GET /api/resource/<namespace>/search?name=<name>&arn=<arn>&resource_type=<resource_type>`

## Configuration

**`config.py`**:

- Manages database connections and app configurations.

## Models

**`models.py`**:

- Defines the Resource model with fields such as `name`, `namespace`, `arn`, `value`, `resource_type`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

## Routes

**`routes.py`**:

- Defines the API endpoints for managing resources, including registering, updating, deleting, and searching resources.

## Additional Notes

- The Bridge application aims to simplify the configuration management process by providing a centralized registry for resources.
- With integration for Terraform, Crossplane, and ArgoCD, it ensures that resources are consistently referenced across different tools without manual updates.
- The use of Docker enables easy deployment and scaling of the application.
